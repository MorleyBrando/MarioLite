#MarioLite

This is an app for both Android and Apple Phones that recreates the classic Super Mario games. This game only has one level but in this level you can jump on pipes, kill koopas and goombas, use the star powerup, grow huge with the red mushroom, and even enter the castle after the victory.

This was a group project done throughout the course of a semester with a group of 5 classmates working on it. It was made on flutter, largely using the flame packages. 

Here is a video showcasing the project
